# Legacy training sources (do not use as authoritative)

This project was initially bootstrapped from an older training program (e.g. the bsappey/cf-training repository and similar legacy materials). That content is **not** the source of truth for this repo.

## Why

- Some legacy examples were **incorrect** or had issues.
- Others were written **only for ColdFusion 2021 and older** and have not been updated for 2023/2025 or current best practice.
- We are **replacing** that legacy with this modernized training; the legacy is not maintained as the reference.

## What to use instead

- **ColdFusion code and examples:** [Adobe ColdFusion User Guide](https://helpx.adobe.com/coldfusion/user-guide.html) (primary) and [CFDocs](https://cfdocs.org/) (secondary). See Code Validation in README and `.cursor/rules/coldfusion-code-standards.mdc`.
- **Module/lesson content:** This repository — `assets/js/modules-data.js` and HOW-TO-CREATE-MODULES.md. When adding or updating content, verify any CF code against Adobe + CFDocs; do not copy from the old training repo without re-verifying.

## If you need to look at legacy

You may look at the old repo for **ideas or structure** only. Do not copy code or examples from it into this repo without checking them against Adobe and CFDocs and updating for CF 2021/2023/2025 as appropriate.
