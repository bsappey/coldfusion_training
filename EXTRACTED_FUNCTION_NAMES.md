# Extracted Function Names from PDFs

## Functions Found in AI Models.pdf

Based on the PDF extraction, I found these function/method names:

1. **getChatModel()** - Gets a chat model
2. **.chat()** - Method on chat model for sending messages
3. **getAIService()** - Gets an AI service instance
4. **Function tools** - Related to function calling

- Pre-requisites

## Next Steps:

The PDF extraction script didn't work perfectly. We need to:

1. **Option A**: Use Adobe Acrobat to export PDFs to text files
2. **Option B**: Manually copy/paste key sections from PDFs
3. **Option C**: Use the PDF_EXTRACTION_WORKSHEET.md to fill in manually

## Recommended Approach:

Since the automated extraction isn't working well, I recommend:

1. Open each PDF in Adobe Acrobat Reader
2. Use "File > Export To > Text" to export each PDF
3. Save the text files in the same folder
4. I can then parse the text files to extract function names and syntax

Or, if you prefer, you can:
- Copy/paste the function reference sections from each PDF
- Share them here
- I'll extract and organize the information
