es — you can safely stop and resume later (your work is saved locally)
All the edits we made are on disk in your workspace, so if you come back on the same machine without resetting/cleaning the repo, you can pick up exactly where you left off.
What changed today (so you know what to reopen)
Main content edits: assets/js/modules-data.js
Module 0: counts fixed (24 modules), AI track summary added, CommandBox tone softened, formatting cleaned (nested lists)
Module 1: scope resolution clarification, queryExecute param syntax fixes, cookie syntax fixes, session logout corrected
Module 2: expanded with input handling + sessions content
Module 3: removed the incorrect “new Query() removed” claims
Status tracker: MODULE_CONTENT_STATUS.md (summary corrected to 7 empty core modules: 4,5,6,7,10,11,12)
README: README.md currently has local modifications (it already reflects 24 modules + AI track correctly).
Important note (git)
Right now, git status shows:
README.md is modified (not committed)
Most of the project (including assets/ and MODULE_CONTENT_STATUS.md) is untracked in git right now
That means:
Resuming later on this same machine: fine.
Resuming on another machine / after a clean checkout: you should commit (or at least stash + ensure untracked files are added) so nothing is lost.
Quick “resume checklist” for next time
Open/reference these:
@README.md
@MODULE_CONTENT_STATUS.md
assets/js/modules-data.js (jump to getModule0Data(), getModule1Data(), getModule2Data(), getModule3Data())
If you want, tell me “make a WIP commit so I can resume anywhere” and I’ll stage the right files and commit them (no push unless you ask).
